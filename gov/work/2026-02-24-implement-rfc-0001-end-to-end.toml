Umbrella implementation work item for RFC-0001.

Goal:
Deliver the full RFC-0001 implementation across CLI, library API, error model, compatibility documentation, and verification pipeline.

Scope:
- End-to-end implementation of clauses C-PROFILES, C-PLAN-OUTPUT, C-LIBRARY-API, C-COMPATIBILITY, and C-ERROR-MODEL.
- Keep SSOT contracts and generated docs synchronized.
- Maintain green validation gates (fmt/check/clippy/tests/govctl check).
