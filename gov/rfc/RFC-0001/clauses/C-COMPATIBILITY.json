  "text": "The project MUST define one canonical CLI behavior model and document it in user-facing documentation.\n\nThe project MUST publish migration notes for every breaking CLI change.\n\nPre-1.0 policy (`0.x`):\n- The project MAY introduce breaking CLI changes without providing a compatibility profile.\n- The project MAY remove ambiguous legacy flags without a guaranteed grace window.\n- Each removal or behavior change MUST include concrete migration guidance in the same release.\n\nPost-1.0 policy (`1.x` and later):\n- Breaking CLI changes MUST occur only in major releases.\n- If a flag is deprecated before removal, the deprecation MUST be documented in help and docs before the major release that removes it.\n\nThe project SHOULD provide an `--explain` mode that reports resolved behavior after profile and explicit overrides are applied.\n\n**Rationale:**\nGiven current product stage and low user volume, rapid iteration without a compatibility layer is acceptable, as long as changes remain explicit and migration guidance is published."
